This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses Bootstrap, Bootstrapmade template, react-router-dom, react-typed. Planning to add animations and continue to update the portfolio section as well.

I used the tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&list=RDCMUC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA&start_radio=1&t=3299
